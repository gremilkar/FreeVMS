 */

/*
  This implementation does not care what the objects are, these are completely
  under user control (who might, for example, maintain a secondary access
  structure such as a linked list). Hence all allocation/deallocation
  of objects is left to the user.

  The user is also given full control over storage allocation for actual
  B-tree nodes. This is done by using the alloc_page, free_page functions,
  and a "page pool" pointer as part of the B-tree datastructure.

  The B-tree can operate as usual, storing objects identified by a single
  key value. Alternatively, it can be set up for storing non-overlapping
  interval objects, i.e. each object occupying an interval of key space.

  In order to use this B+ tree implementation, you'll need to (in btree_conf.h):
   - define a type "BTkey", which is the type of the keys to the
     B+ tree.
   - define "BT_ORDER" as the maximum spread of the B-tree.
     Must be odd.
   - Define the following macros for dealing with keys:
        BTGetObjKey(object)	returns the key to object
	BTKeyLT(key1, key2)	key1 <  key2
	BTKeyGT(key1, key2)	key1 >  key2
	BTKeyEQ(key1, key2)	key1 == key2
     If you want the B+ tree to store objects taking up an interval of
     key space (rather than just a single value), define
	BTGetObjLim(object)     returns upper limit key value (i.e.
	                        the next value available as key for another
				object)
	BTObjMatch(obj, key)	key  IN obj (if the key lies within the
	                        object, i.e. obj->key <= key < obj->limit)
	BTOverlaps(obj1, obj2)  objects overlap.
     For normal B+-trees, leave those undefined.
   - define a type "GBTObject", which should be a pointer to a struct
     containing the data to be indexed.
     It is the pointer values which will be stored in the B+ tree.
   - provide a (possibly empty) function
        void BTPrintObj(GBTObject const obj);
     which will be used for printing your objects by "BTPrint".
   - defined a type "PagePool". Pointers to this type are contained
     in B+ tree references. This ensures that pages are allocated from the
     correct pool, in case several B+ trees are used
   - define functions
        struct sBTPage *alloc_page(PagePool *pool);
	void free_page(PagePool *pool, struct sBTPage *page);
     for (de)allocating pages for the B+ tree.
