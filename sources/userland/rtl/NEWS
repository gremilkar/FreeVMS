	I'm releasing a very preliminary version of this library with
	date/time functions contributed by Paul Nankervis. I've
	modified his functions to be more compatible with the
	VMS header files SYS$ROUTINES.H and LIB$ROUTINES.H, broke
	them into seperate files and applied a couple of int/long
	changes to various parameters.

	I will probibly rename this package to 'starlet' from 'str'
	in the next release, because it is starting to contain a lot
	more than just STR$ routines in it.

	Very few of these routines have been well tested, and even
	fewer have been compared against the actual VMS routines,
	however they all compile on a Linux/Intel system.
	I really need an extensive set of test programs to exercise
	the functions (Subtle hint, any takers?).

	The Makefile has been reworked slightly to include a 'clean'
	function to wipe out all compiled code so I could put out
	a clean distribution.
